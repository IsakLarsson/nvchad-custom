# nvchad-custom

My new main Neovim config, these are my files for customizing it.

If you want to try this setup out just install NvChad as per their [installation instructions](https://nvchad.com/docs/quickstart/install) and either:
- Clone this repo and replace the `nvim/lua/custom` folder in your NvChad installation with this `custom` folder.
- Just run these commands:
```
git clone https://github.com/IsakLarsson/nvchad-custom.git ~/.config/nvchad-custom
rm -rf ~/.config/nvim/lua/custom
ln -s ~/.config/nvchad-custom/custom ~/.config/nvim/lua/
```

Shoutout @siduck and https://github.com/NvChad/NvChad for the BLAZINGLY fast neovim experience.
