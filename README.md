# nvchad-custom

Decided to try out NvChad as a base for my new neovim config, these are my files for customizing it.

If you want to try this setup out just install NvChad as per their [installation instructions](https://nvchad.com/docs/quickstart/install), clone this repo and replace the `nvim/lua/custom` folder in your NvChad installation with this `custom` folder.

Shoutout @siduck and https://github.com/NvChad/NvChad for the BLAZINGLY fast neovim experience.
